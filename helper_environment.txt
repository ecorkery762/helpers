1. GIT
1.1 Structure of local (master branch) to github (hosting - remote branch) and moving files to github

    Local (master branch)
    - git clone link from github
    - git status and git init
    - edit a file
    - save locally (working directory)

    Local to staging before pushing to github
    - git add to place file in staging area (including git add .). Note: still local only
    - git commit them (all added files) to the master branch which we have locally

    Staging to github
    - Check for remote branch (will have if cloned from github) with command git remote -v [v for view].
      This command returns the url of the remote repo.
    - By convention the remote branch is named "origin"
    - Note: when creating a repository on github you will have the option of cloning a local directory.
      But we created on github first and then cloned to local in the setup phase.
    - Note: git remote rename and git remote remove to rename and remove the remote repository.
    - Command: git push -u origin main

    Git Push
    Git push - old method
        git add helper_git.txt
        git commit -m "first attempt for helper_git.txt"
        git push -u origin main  [user:  ecorkery762  password: ]   ... Authentication - see 1.2
        git push -u origin main [Matt Harrison recommends]

        Git fails authentication with:
        remote: Invalid username or token. Password authentication is not supported for Git operations.
        fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/ecorkery762/helpers.git/'

        This error is clear and very common 👍
        GitHub no longer allows password authentication for git push over HTTPS. You must use either a 
        Personal Access Token (PAT) or SSH.

    Git push - PAT
        Get the PAT:
        Github: https://github.com/settings/profile [from profile on top RHS]
        Github: developer settings which is last on the list-menu on the LHS of settings
        Personal access token (classic)
            Custom to 2 days and note password use
            repo boxes highlighted [the top one - leave rest alone]
            generate and save (think can generate another one if required)
            save token to notepad as will not see again

    The push using PAT
        Reset of global parameter required so check base
            git config --show-origin --get credential.helper
            ANS: file:/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/share/git-core/gitconfig	osxkeychain 
        
        git push -u origin main

        Username for 'https://github.com': ecorkery762
        Password for 'https://ecorkery762@github.com': <PAT>

2. Virtual Environments

    Copy of the base installation which allows versions of libraries to be installed as required
    it is created (standard venv) and activeated (switching from base to virtual).

    Activation involves updating the PATH variable with the correct environment for the python
    binary being executed.

2.1 Creation commands

    which python
    python --version
    <python version/path> -m venv <your environment name>


2.2 Activation commands non-windows

    source <path-to-env>/bin/activate

2.3 Actual commands [updated to ~/projects_enviromnents to keep all virtual together]


    (base) % cd /Users/ec/projects_environments/virtual
    (base) % echo $PATH
    (base) % which python
    (base) % python --version
    (base) % python3.12 --version
             Python 3.12.7
    # CREATE
    (base) % python3.12 -m venv python_train_udemy_fb00_fundamentals
    (base) % cd python_train_udemy_fb00_fundamentals
    (base) % ls -l

    # ACTIVATE
    (base) % source python_train_udemy_fb00_fundamentals/bin/activate
     OR    % source ~/projects_environments/virtual/python_train_udemy_fb00_fundamentals/bin/activate

    (pydantic_train_fb) (base) ec@Erics-MacBook-Pro Fred_Baptiste_05_Pydantic %

    (pydantic_train_fb) (base) % echo $PATH
    (pydantic_train_fb) (base) % which python3.12
                                 /Users/ec/projects_environments/virtual/pydantic_train_udemy_fb/bin/python3.12

     # DEACTIVATE
     (pydantic_train_fb) (base) % deactivate
     base) % echo $PATH
     base) % which python3.12

     #Remove
     rm -rf <directory>


2.4 Installing libraries

    pip install numpy==1.2.2   # >=, >
    cp ~/Documents/COURSES/Courses_Udemy/Fred_Baptiste_01_Fundamentals/python-fundamentals-main/02\ -\ Installing\ and\ Running\ Python/requirements.txt ./

    pip install jupyterthemes
    pip freeze                        # list what was installed in the virtual environment

    pip install -r requirements.txt






    3. Running Jupyter Notebooks
    ============================

    From a command prompt:
    1. Navigate to your project root folder.
    2. Activate your virtual environment
    3. run Jupyter notebooks: jupyter notebook .
    4. If a web browser does not automatically open up, find the URL in the command prompt window (output when Jupyter starts up), and paste that URL into your browser.

    You can create Jupyter notebooks anywhere in your project folder - it does not have to be in the root of your project folder, you can create sub-folders and organize your notebooks however you want - just like you wold organize Excel or Word documents.

    Keyboard Shortcuts
    ------------------
    - execute a cell: Shift+Enter
    - select current cell: Esc (or click on cell margin)
    - delete selected cell: DD (type D twice in succession)
    - change selected cell to Markup: M
    - change selected cell to Code: Y
    - save: S
    - insert cell above current selected cell: B
    - insert cell after currently selected cell: A

    Don't forget to re-run your Jupyter notebook when you re-load it later - this will just re-execute all the cells (but it will stop processing the cells if it encounters an error).
