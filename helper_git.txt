1. Structure of local (master branch) to github (hosting - remote branch) and moving files to github

    Local (master branch)
    - git clone link from github
    - git status and git init
    - edit a file
    - save locally (working directory)

    Local to staging before pushing to github
    - git add to place file in staging area (including git add .). Note: still local only
    - git commit them (all added files) to the master branch which we have locally

    Staging to github
    - Check for remote branch (will have if cloned from github) with command git remote -v [v for view].
      This command returns the url of the remote repo.
    - By convention the remote branch is named "origin"
    - Note: when creating a repository on github you will have the option of cloning a local directory.
      But we created on github first and then cloned to local in the setup phase.
    - Note: git remote rename and git remote remove to rename and remove the remote repository.
    - Command: git push -u origin main
